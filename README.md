- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sisaphys
 it feels like this has been an uphill journey from the start. 
 did most of it to myself, can't deny that.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... seeing just how many people fill these thlngs out and what kind of response or assistance it might possibly generate.
  I will admit to being a little impressed with the site so far. the Hub seems organized, maybe I can find wnat i thlnk I'm looking for.  
- So, middle age sucks. Tore myself apart making it this far, trying to shift gears into something less physically demanding. Or maybe demeaning is the proper term...?
I got an Arduino Uno kit. It's a start. I've a few ideas I'm going to try make work. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to live again
  damn, that looks so pretentious 
  
  Think Im going to learn Python, seems like a good enough place to start.
  Im open to suggestions
  I have no idea what I'm doing, but I can get paid to milk this laptop from home as well as anybody
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
